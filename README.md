ExtremelyhighaccuracyandefficiencyofTrafficSignRecog- nition (TSR) are crucial for driving autonomous vehicles(AVs). A new extreme learning machine based TSR framework with spatial and time- frequency feature fusion technology, named as STF-ELM, is proposed in this paper. Histogram equalization is employed to enhance the traf- fic sign image preprocessing, which contributes to balancing distribution of intensity and sharpness. In addition to the existing histogram of ori- ented gradients(HOG) for extracting spatial features, the time-frequency domainâ€™s feature, Gabor representation, is also used. The compressively fused feature vector is mapped to the predicated traffic signs via ELM network. The experimental results showed that the proposed STF-ELM achieved almost perfect performance with zero-error for most of cate- gories, and outperformed the state-of-the-art TSR methods on the Ger- man Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark(GTSRB).
